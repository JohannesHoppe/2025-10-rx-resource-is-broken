# Angular Resource API Demo

This project demonstrates bugs in Angular's experimental Resource APIs (`resource()`, `rxResource()`, `httpResource()`).

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0-rc.0.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: 20.19.0 or higher
- **npm**: 8.0.0 or higher

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
